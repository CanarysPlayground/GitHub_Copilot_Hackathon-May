# GitHub Copilot Hackathon Event Guide

## Introduction to the Hackathon

Welcome to the **GitHub Copilot Hackathon**, a hands-on coding marathon where you’ll solve programming challenges with GitHub’s AI pair programmer. This 2–3-hour event is organized similar to a mini hackathon, where participants address small challenges to demonstrate GitHub Copilot's features and encourage innovative problem-solving.

GitHub Copilot is meant to assist, not replace you. During the Hackathon, you will pair with Copilot to write code faster and explore innovative ideas. Try out advanced features like **agent mode**, where Copilot autonomously handles multi-step tasks, including analysing code, writing and editing files, running commands, and correcting errors. This allows you to focus on creativity and problem-solving.

## Objective

The Hackathon aims to familiarize participants with GitHub Copilot’s AI by engaging in practical challenges. Through this event, participants will learn to use Copilot effectively to enhance productivity, improve coding quality, and solve complex tasks efficiently.

## Guidelines

- **Tech Stack Freedom:** Use any programming language or framework. Choose familiar languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, etc.) or try new ones – Copilot supports many.
- **Individual Participation:** This is a solo Hackathon. Work individually on the challenges. Engage with Copilot and do all coding yourself, but feel free to discuss ideas and ask questions.
- **Use Copilot’s Power:** Leverage GitHub Copilot, including autocomplete suggestions, the Copilot Chat interface, and agent mode if available. Experiment with these features to see how Copilot can assist beyond completing code lines.
- **Best Practices with Copilot:** To get the most out of Copilot, keep these best practices in mind:
  - **Provide Context** – Give Copilot as much context as possible about what you’re trying to do.
  - **Use Meaningful Names** – Name your variables and functions clearly. Copilot’s suggestions improve when it can infer intent from your naming.
  - **Start Small and Iterate** – Break down large problems into manageable pieces. Don’t try to get Copilot to solve an entire challenge in one giant prompt.
  - **Validate and Learn** – Always review Copilot’s output and test your code. Copilot is a powerful assistant, but it’s not infallible – it might occasionally suggest something that doesn’t fit or that contains a bug.

### 2. Interactive To-Do List App

#### Goal

Build a simple to-do list application that runs in the browser.

#### Requirements

- **Task Management:** Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Categorization:** Enable users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, urgent).
- **Due Dates and Reminders:** Allow users to set due dates and receive reminders for upcoming tasks.
- **Priority Levels:** Users should be able to assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
- **Search and Filter:** Provide functionality to search and filter tasks based on keywords, categories, or priority.

> **Tip:** Try to use complex or multiple datasets to enhance your solutions!
